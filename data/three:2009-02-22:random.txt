Repeating is in all cases something wasteful, regardless whether it's written, shown, said, sensed. Granted, there are different kinds of reiterating, I see it as scope-based information.

<p>
If data is transferred to a group of persons, for example, someone in a meeting said someone stole his coffeecup, it's pointless for the same someone to enforce the details of the theft on a person attending the meeting, it takes time for both parties and it makes the receiving party annoyed in most cases.

On the other hand, if the victim of the coffeecup-crime want to relay his story to someone outside the original meeting, he has to repeat his story in some way or the other. 
The repeatal is subjective to the story teller, the source material, but to no one else.

The main reason behind gatherings, public speaking and the "reply all"-function in email-clients is to remove unnecessary duplication of information and procedure. 
In most cases the reprisal of data is destructive and will lead to even more replication of the source information.
